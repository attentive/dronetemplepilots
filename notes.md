### Required purchases

* Frame: Lumenier QAV-X Charpu FPV Racing Drone 214mm

* Lumenier links: http://www.lumenier.com/products/multirotors/qav-x 
* Build manual: http://www.lumenier.com/products/multirotors/qav-x/qav-x-build-manual

* The airframe comes with high quality aluminum hardware. All screws are premium, black oxide steel. The spacers have a textured grip surface treatment, which facilitates holding of the spacers during assembly and servicing of the airframe. The spacers are also 28mm tall vs the standard 35mm. This gives the airframe a sleek, low profile look. 
* Included with the QAV-X CHARPU kit is the popular Lumenier 4Power power distribution board which can be fitted with an optional Pololu voltage drop-down circuit (to 12v or 5v), a XT60 pig-tail. Like the QAV210/180, the QAV-X kit enables mounting of small FPV camers such as the Lumenier CM-650 in a fully encased assembly which protects the FPV camera during crashes and enables pointing the FPV camera at a wide variety of viewing angles.
